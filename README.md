# Trolley to LLM

A side-by-side comparison tool that presents moral dilemmas (trolley-problem style and beyond) to multiple LLMs simultaneously, each optionally constrained by a different ethical worldview. Every run queries the LLMs live and appends the result to a persistent history file. Questions can be created, edited, and deleted from the UI; every mutation is persisted to disk immediately.

## What it does

- Loads a set of dilemmas from `backend/questions.json`, which is kept in sync with all in-app edits.
- Lets you **create, edit, and delete questions** directly from the UI without touching any files.
- Lets you configure one or more **slots**, each pairing an LLM with a moral worldview (e.g. GPT-4o as a Kantian deontologist, Claude as a utilitarian).
- Sends each slot's question to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) with the worldview injected as a system prompt.
- Displays each model's choice, reasoning, and identified moral framework side by side.
- Persists results to `backend/data/responses.json` as an append-only history; each record includes a snapshot of the question title, prompt, and options at the time of asking and a `question_hash` derived from that content, so the record remains meaningful even if the question is later edited.
- Deduplicates stored responses by `(question_hash, model_id, worldview_id)`: a response is only written once per unique combination of question content, model, and worldview; running the same question again with the same slots produces a fresh LLM response but does not add a duplicate to history.
- Lets you export all collected responses as JSON or CSV.
- Supports bulk-replacing the question set by uploading a JSON or CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 11.1.2 for the frontend
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key

## Setup

### 1. Backend

Create a local virtual environment and install the Python dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the API:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive docs are available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

The backend reads the OpenRouter API key from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Export it in your shell or provide it through your local environment before querying models.

### 2. Frontend

The frontend uses pnpm only. Do not use npm or yarn in `frontend/`.

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The UI will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

If pnpm is unavailable but Corepack is installed, enable pnpm first:

```bash
corepack enable pnpm
```

## Usage

1. Open `http://localhost:5173`.
2. Navigate between questions with the **Prev / Next** buttons on the question card.
3. Configure slots in the **Test Slots** panel; each slot is one (model, worldview) pair. Click **+ Add slot** to compare more combinations at once. Use the **i** button next to each worldview to read its full system prompt.
4. Click **Send to All Models** to query all slots live. Results appear in the table below and are appended to the response history.
5. Change a slot's model or worldview and click **Send to All Models** again; the new combination is queried and saved.
6. Use **+ Add Question** in the header to create a new question from scratch.
7. Use the **pencil icon** on any question card to edit its title, prompt, or options.
8. Use the **trash icon** to delete a question (requires confirmation).
9. Use the **Export** button to download all accumulated responses as JSON or CSV.
10. Use **Upload** to bulk-replace the question set with a JSON or CSV file (see format below).

## Managing questions

### In-app (recommended)

Use the **+ Add Question** button in the header to open a form. Fill in the title, prompt, and at least two options, then click **Save**. To edit or delete an existing question use the icons on the question card.

All changes are immediately written back to `backend/questions.json`.

### Directly in questions.json

Each question requires:

```json
{
  "id": 8,
  "title": "Short display title",
  "prompt": "Full scenario description...",
  "options": ["Option A", "Option B"]
}
```

CSV uploads are also supported (`id`, `title`, `prompt`, `options` columns; options separated by `;`).

## Response history and deduplication

Every "Send to All Models" click queries the LLMs live; there is no serving from cache. Results are appended to `backend/data/responses.json` as history.

Before writing, the backend computes a `question_hash` (SHA-256 of the normalized title, prompt, and options) and checks whether a record with the same `(question_hash, model_id, worldview_id)` already exists. If one does, the new result is silently discarded so the history stays free of exact duplicates. Editing a question's text or options changes its hash, so subsequent runs produce new history entries rather than colliding with old ones.

Each stored record includes a full snapshot of the question title, prompt, and options alongside the hash, keeping exported data self-contained even after the question has been further edited or deleted.

## Adding models

Edit the `MODELS` list in `backend/config.py`:

```python
{"model_id": "mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct", "display_name": "Mistral 7B"},
```

Any model ID supported by OpenRouter works.

## Adding worldviews

Edit the `WORLDVIEWS` list in `backend/config.py`. Each entry needs an `id`, a `label`, and a `system_prompt` (empty string for no guidance):

```python
{
    "id": "rawlsian",
    "label": "Rawlsiano",
    "system_prompt": "Razonas desde la posición rawlsiana del velo de la ignorancia...",
},
```
